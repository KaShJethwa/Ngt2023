To perform these queries, you need to insert a sample dataset into MongoDB and then execute the queries. Below is an example of how you can create a collection named "restaurants" and perform the specified queries in MongoDB:

First, create a JSON file named "restaurant.json" with sample data:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "restaurant_id": "1",
    "name": "Restaurant 1",
    "borough": "Bronx",
    "cuisine": "Italian",
    "address": {
      "zipcode": "10458"
    }
  },
  {
    "restaurant_id": "2",
    "name": "Restaurant 2",
    "borough": "Manhattan",
    "cuisine": "French",
    "address": {
      "zipcode": "10001"
    }
  },
  {
    "restaurant_id": "3",
    "name": "Restaurant 3",
    "borough": "Bronx",
    "cuisine": "Mexican",
    "address": {
      "zipcode": "10472"
    }
  }
]
Now, you can insert this data into MongoDB and perform the requested queries:

Display all documents in the "restaurants" collection:
javascript
Copy code
db.restaurants.find({})
Display specific fields for all documents:
javascript
Copy code
db.restaurants.find({}, { restaurant_id: 1, name: 1, borough: 1, cuisine: 1, _id: 0 })
Display specific fields while excluding the "_id" field:
javascript
Copy code
db.restaurants.find({}, { restaurant_id: 1, name: 1, borough: 1, cuisine: 1, _id: 0 })
Display specific fields, including the zip code, while excluding the "_id" field:
javascript
Copy code
db.restaurants.find({}, { restaurant_id: 1, name: 1, borough: 1, "address.zipcode": 1, _id: 0 })
Display all restaurants in the borough "Bronx":
javascript
Copy code
db.restaurants.find({ borough: "Bronx" })
Please ensure that you've inserted the data into your MongoDB instance and replace the field names and database name with your actual data. The queries should work with this sample dataset.

(A)	Write a jQuery to animate multiple CSS properties.
(B)	Write a jQuery effect method with a callback function.
ChatGPT
(A) Here's an example of how to use jQuery to animate multiple CSS properties on an HTML element:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            $("#myElement").click(function () {
                $(this).animate({
                    left: '200px',
                    opacity: 0.5,
                    width: '+=50px'
                }, 1000); // 1000 milliseconds (1 second) duration
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        #myElement {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: blue;
            position: relative;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="myElement"></div>
</body>
</html>
In this example, when you click on the element with the ID "myElement," it will animate the "left" position, "opacity," and "width" properties simultaneously. The animation will take 1 second to complete.

(B) Here's an example of a jQuery effect method with a callback function:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            $("#myButton").click(function () {
                $("#myElement").hide("slow", function () {
                    alert("Element hidden!");
                });
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Hide Element</button>
    <div id="myElement" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: red;"></div>
</body>
</html>
In this example, when you click the "Hide Element" button, the "hide" effect is used with the "slow" duration, and a callback function is provided. When the element is hidden, it will trigger the callback function that displays an alert saying "Element hidden!" This is useful for performing actions after the animation is completed.

Create a JSON file and persist it

        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "age": 25,
        "city": "Los Angeles"
    },
    {
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "age": 35,

(A)	Create Restaurant.json into MongoDb and perform the following queries
1.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant name, borough, longitude and attitude and cuisine for those restaurants which contains 'mon' as three letters somewhere in its name
2.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant name, borough, longitude and latitude and cuisine for those restaurants which contain 'Mad' as first three letters of its name
3.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurants which locate in latitude value less than -95.754168
4.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, borough and cuisine for those restaurants which contain 'Wil' as first three letters for its name.
Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, borough and cuisine for those restaurants which contain 'ces' as last three letters for its name.
To perform the specified queries in MongoDB, you need to have a collection named "restaurants" in your MongoDB database with relevant data. Here are the queries:

1. Find the restaurant name, borough, longitude, attitude, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'mon' as three letters somewhere in their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /mon/i // The 'i' option makes the regex case-insensitive
   },
   {
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      "address.coord": 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

2. Find the restaurant name, borough, longitude, latitude, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'Mad' as the first three letters of their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /^Mad/i // The '^' denotes the start of the string, and 'i' makes it case-insensitive
   },
   {
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      "address.coord": 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

3. Find the restaurants located in latitude values less than -95.754168:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      "address.coord.1": { $lt: -95.754168 }
   }
)
```

4. Find the restaurant Id, name, borough, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'Wil' as the first three letters of their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /^Wil/i // The '^' denotes the start of the string, and 'i' makes it case-insensitive
   },
   {
      restaurant_id: 1,
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

5. Find the restaurant Id, name, borough, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'ces' as the last three letters of their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /ces$/i // The '$' denotes the end of the string, and 'i' makes it case-insensitive
   },
   {
      restaurant_id: 1,
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

These queries assume you have a collection named "restaurants" with documents structured according to your requirements. Replace "restaurants" with your actual collection name and adapt the field names as needed to match your data structure.
(A) Write a jQuery to Select elements by class name,id and element name.
(B) Write a jQuery to show the use of Click (), hover (), on (), trigger (), off () events.
(A) To select elements by class name, ID, and element name using jQuery:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Select elements by class name
            $(".example-class").css("color", "red");

            // Select elements by ID
            $("#example-id").css("font-weight", "bold");

            // Select elements by element name (e.g., <p>)
            $("p").css("background-color", "yellow");
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="example-class">This is a paragraph with class 'example-class'.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph without a specific class or ID.</p>
    <p>This is a third paragraph without a specific class or ID.</p>
    <div id="example-id">This is a div with ID 'example-id'.</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Elements with the class "example-class" have their text color changed to red.
- The element with the ID "example-id" has its font weight changed to bold.
- All `<p>` elements have their background color changed to yellow.

(B) To demonstrate the use of jQuery events (Click, hover, on, trigger, off):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Click event
            $("#click-button").click(function () {
                $(this).text("Clicked!");
            });

            // Hover event
            $("#hover-div").hover(
                function () {
                    $(this).text("Mouse over!");
                },
                function () {
                    $(this).text("Mouse out!");
                }
            );

            // On event
            $("#on-button").on("mouseenter", function () {
                $(this).text("Mouse entered!");
            });

            // Trigger event
            $("#trigger-button").click(function () {
                $("#trigger-div").trigger("mouseenter");
            });

            // Off event
            $("#off-button").on("click", function () {
                $("#off-div").off("mouseenter");
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="click-button">Click Me</button>
    <div id="hover-div">Hover over me</div>
    <button id="on-button">Mouse Enter</button>
    <button id="trigger-button">Trigger Event</button>
    <div id="trigger-div"></div>
    <button id="off-button">Remove Event</button>
    <div id="off-div">Mouse Enter Event Removed</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The "Click Me" button triggers a click event that changes its text to "Clicked!"
- The "Hover over me" div triggers hover events that change the text when the mouse enters or leaves the div.
- The "Mouse Enter" button uses the "on" event to listen for a mouseenter event on the button.
- The "Trigger Event" button triggers the mouseenter event on the "trigger-div."
- The "Remove Event" button uses the "off" event to remove the mouseenter event from the "off-div."
Write a jQuery to Create slide-up, slide-down and slide-Toggle effect.
Write a MongoDB query to insert, retrieve, update and delete documents.

(A) To create slide-up, slide-down, and slideToggle effects using jQuery, you can use the following code as an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Slide Down
            $("#slideDownButton").click(function () {
                $("#slideDownDiv").slideDown();
            });

            // Slide Up
            $("#slideUpButton").click(function () {
                $("#slideUpDiv").slideUp();
            });

            // Slide Toggle
            $("#slideToggleButton").click(function () {
                $("#slideToggleDiv").slideToggle();
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        #slideDownDiv, #slideUpDiv, #slideToggleDiv {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: lightblue;
            display: none;
            margin: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="slideDownButton">Slide Down</button>
    <div id="slideDownDiv">Slide Down Content</div>

    <button id="slideUpButton">Slide Up</button>
    <div id="slideUpDiv">Slide Up Content</div>

    <button id="slideToggleButton">Slide Toggle</button>
    <div id="slideToggleDiv">Slide Toggle Content</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Clicking the "Slide Down" button will make the content in the "slideDownDiv" slide down.
- Clicking the "Slide Up" button will make the content in the "slideUpDiv" slide up.
- Clicking the "Slide Toggle" button will toggle the visibility of the content in the "slideToggleDiv."

(B) To insert, retrieve, update, and delete documents in MongoDB, you can use the MongoDB shell. Here are example queries for each operation:

**Insert Documents:**

```javascript
// Insert a single document
db.myCollection.insertOne({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
});

// Insert multiple documents
db.myCollection.insertMany([
    { name: "Alice Smith", age: 25, city: "Los Angeles" },
    { name: "Bob Johnson", age: 35, city: "Chicago" }
]);
```

**Retrieve Documents:**

```javascript
// Retrieve all documents in the collection
db.myCollection.find();

// Retrieve documents that match a specific condition (e.g., age greater than 30)
db.myCollection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } });
```

**Update Documents:**

```javascript
// Update a single document
db.myCollection.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $set: { age: 31 } });

// Update multiple documents
db.myCollection.updateMany({ city: "New York" }, { $set: { city: "Albany" } });
```

**Delete Documents:**

```javascript
// Delete a single document
db.myCollection.deleteOne({ name: "Alice Smith" });

// Delete multiple documents
db.myCollection.deleteMany({ city: "Albany" });
```

These queries demonstrate basic operations in MongoDB using the MongoDB shell. In a real-world scenario, you might want to use a driver or an application to interact with MongoDB programmatically.
  Create Restaurant.json into MongoDb and perform the following queries
1.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurants that do not prepare any cuisine of 'American' and their grade score more than 70 and latitude less than -65.754168
2.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurants which do not prepare any cuisine of 'American' and achieved a score more than 70 and located in the longitude less than -65.754168.
3.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurants which do not prepare any cuisine of 'American ' and achieved a grade point 'A' not belongs to the borough Brooklyn. The document must be displayed according to the cuisine in descending order
4.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, borough and cuisine for those restaurants which contain 'Wil' as first three letters for its name.
Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, borough and cuisine for those restaurants which contain 'ces' as last three letters for its name.
To perform the specified queries in MongoDB, you need to have a collection named "restaurants" in your MongoDB database with relevant data. Here are the queries you've requested:

1. Find the restaurants that do not prepare any cuisine of 'American,' have a grade score greater than 70, and latitude less than -65.754168:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   $and: [
      { cuisine: { $ne: "American" } },
      { "grades.score": { $gt: 70 } },
      { "address.coord.1": { $lt: -65.754168 } }
   ]
})
```

2. Find the restaurants that do not prepare any cuisine of 'American,' achieved a score greater than 70, and located in longitude less than -65.754168:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   $and: [
      { cuisine: { $ne: "American" } },
      { "grades.score": { $gt: 70 } },
      { "address.coord.0": { $lt: -65.754168 } }
   ]
})
```

3. Find the restaurants that do not prepare any cuisine of 'American,' achieved a grade point 'A,' and do not belong to the borough Brooklyn. Display the documents according to cuisine in descending order:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   $and: [
      { cuisine: { $ne: "American" } },
      { "grades.grade": "A" },
      { borough: { $ne: "Brooklyn" } }
   ]
}).sort({ cuisine: -1 })
```

4. Find the restaurant Id, name, borough, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'Wil' as the first three letters of their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /^Wil/i // The '^' denotes the start of the string, and 'i' makes it case-insensitive
   },
   {
      restaurant_id: 1,
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

5. Find the restaurant Id, name, borough, and cuisine for those restaurants that contain 'ces' as the last three letters of their name:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find(
   {
      name: /ces$/i // The '$' denotes the end of the string, and 'i' makes it case-insensitive
   },
   {
      restaurant_id: 1,
      name: 1,
      borough: 1,
      cuisine: 1,
      _id: 0
   }
)
```

These queries assume you have a collection named "restaurants" with documents structured according to your requirements. Replace "restaurants" with your actual collection name and adapt the field names as needed to match your data structure.
(A)	Write a jQuery to add and remove CSS classes from the HTML elements.
(B)	Write a jQuery to set the duration in slide toggle effect.
(A) To add and remove CSS classes from HTML elements using jQuery, you can use the `addClass()` and `removeClass()` methods. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Add a CSS class when a button is clicked
            $("#add-class-button").click(function () {
                $("#target-element").addClass("highlight");
            });

            // Remove a CSS class when another button is clicked
            $("#remove-class-button").click(function () {
                $("#target-element").removeClass("highlight");
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        .highlight {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="target-element">This is an element.</div>
    <button id="add-class-button">Add Class</button>
    <button id="remove-class-button">Remove Class</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Clicking the "Add Class" button adds the "highlight" CSS class to the element with the ID "target-element," changing its background color to yellow.
- Clicking the "Remove Class" button removes the "highlight" CSS class, restoring the element's original styling.

(B) To set the duration in the slideToggle effect using jQuery, you can use the `slideToggle()` method. Here's how to set the duration:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Set the duration of slideToggle to 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
            $("#toggle-button").click(function () {
                $("#toggle-element").slideToggle(1000);
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        #toggle-element {
            background-color: lightblue;
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="toggle-element">Toggle Me</div>
    <button id="toggle-button">Toggle</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Clicking the "Toggle" button applies the `slideToggle()` effect with a duration of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to the element with the ID "toggle-element." This sets the speed of the slide animation to be slower or faster.
Create Restaurant.json into MongoDb and perform the following queries
1.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, borough and cuisine for those restaurants which prepared dish except 'American' and 'Chinees' or restaurant's name begins with letter 'Wil'
2.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, and grades for those restaurants which achieved a grade of "A" and scored 11 on an ISODate "2014- 08-11T00:00:00Z" among many of survey dates.
3.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name and grades for those restaurants where the 2nd element of grades array contains a grade of "A" and score 9 on an ISODate "2014-08-11T00:00:00Z"
4.	Write a MongoDB query to find the restaurant Id, name, address and geographical location for those restaurants where 2nd element of coord array contains a value which is more than 42 and upto 52.
Write a MongoDB query to arrange the name of the restaurants in ascending order along with all the columns.
To perform the specified queries in MongoDB, you should have a collection named "restaurants" in your MongoDB database with relevant data. Here are the queries you've requested:

1. Find the restaurant Id, name, borough, and cuisine for restaurants that prepared dishes other than 'American' and 'Chinese,' or whose name begins with the letter 'Wil':

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   $or: [
      { $and: [{ cuisine: { $nin: ["American", "Chinese"] } }, { name: /^Wil/i }] },
      { name: /^Wil/i }
   ]
}, {
   restaurant_id: 1,
   name: 1,
   borough: 1,
   cuisine: 1,
   _id: 0
})
```

2. Find the restaurant Id, name, and grades for restaurants that achieved a grade of "A" and scored 11 on an ISODate "2014-08-11T00:00:00Z" among many survey dates:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   grades: {
      $elemMatch: { grade: "A", score: 11, date: ISODate("2014-08-11T00:00:00Z") }
   }
}, {
   restaurant_id: 1,
   name: 1,
   grades: 1,
   _id: 0
})
```

3. Find the restaurant Id, name, and grades for restaurants where the 2nd element of the grades array contains a grade of "A" and a score of 9 on an ISODate "2014-08-11T00:00:00Z":

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   "grades.1.grade": "A",
   "grades.1.score": 9,
   "grades.1.date": ISODate("2014-08-11T00:00:00Z")
}, {
   restaurant_id: 1,
   name: 1,
   grades: 1,
   _id: 0
})
```

4. Find the restaurant Id, name, address, and geographical location for restaurants where the 2nd element of the coord array contains a value between 42 and 52:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   "address.coord.1": { $gt: 42, $lte: 52 }
}, {
   restaurant_id: 1,
   name: 1,
   "address.street": 1,
   "address.coord": 1,
   _id: 0
})
```

5. Arrange the names of the restaurants in ascending order along with all columns:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({}, { _id: 0 }).sort({ name: 1 })
```

These queries assume you have a collection named "restaurants" with documents structured according to your requirements. Replace "restaurants" with your actual collection name and adapt the field names as needed to match your data structure.
Write a jQuery to set the duration in slide toggle effect.
To set the duration for the slide toggle effect in jQuery, you can use the `slideToggle()` method and specify the duration in milliseconds as an argument. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Set the duration of slideToggle to 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
            $("#toggle-button").click(function () {
                $("#toggle-element").slideToggle(1000);
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        #toggle-element {
            background-color: lightblue;
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="toggle-element">Toggle Me</div>
    <button id="toggle-button">Toggle</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Clicking the "Toggle" button applies the `slideToggle()` effect with a duration of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to the element with the ID "toggle-element." This sets the speed of the slide animation to be slower or faster.

You can adjust the duration (1000 in this example) to your preferred value in milliseconds to control the speed of the animation.
Create Restaurant.json into MongoDb and perform the following queries
1.	Write a MongoDB query to arrange the name of the restaurants in descending along with all the columns
2.	Write a MongoDB query to arranged the name of the cuisine in ascending order and for that same cuisine borough should be in descending order
3.	Write a MongoDB query to know whether all the addresses contains the street or not.
4.	Write a MongoDB query which will select all documents in the restaurants collection where the coord field value is double
5.	Write a MongoDB query which will select the restaurant Id, name and grades for those restaurants which returns 0 as a remainder after dividing the score by 7.

To perform the specified queries in MongoDB, you should have a collection named "restaurants" in your MongoDB database with relevant data. Here are the queries you've requested:

1. Arrange the name of the restaurants in descending order along with all columns:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({}, { _id: 0 }).sort({ name: -1 })
```

2. Arrange the name of the cuisine in ascending order, and for the same cuisine, the borough should be in descending order:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({}, { _id: 0 }).sort({ cuisine: 1, borough: -1 })
```

3. Check whether all the addresses contain the "street" or not:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   "address.street": { $exists: true, $ne: null }
}, {
   _id: 0,
   name: 1,
   "address.street": 1
})
```

4. Select all documents in the restaurants collection where the "coord" field value is a double:

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   "address.coord": { $type: "double" }
}, {
   _id: 0
})
```

5. Select the restaurant Id, name, and grades for those restaurants where the score is divisible by 7 (remainder is 0):

```javascript
db.restaurants.find({
   "grades.score": { $mod: [7, 0] }
}, {
   _id: 0,
   restaurant_id: 1,
   name: 1,
   grades: 1
})
```

These queries assume you have a collection named "restaurants" with documents structured according to your requirements. Replace "restaurants" with your actual collection name and adapt the field names as needed to match your data structure.
A.	Write a jQuery to animate multiple CSS properties.
You can use jQuery's `animate()` method to animate multiple CSS properties. Here's an example of how to animate the width, height, and opacity properties of an HTML element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            $("#animate-button").click(function () {
                // Select the element to be animated
                var element = $("#animated-element");

                // Define the CSS properties and their target values
                var properties = {
                    width: "200px",
                    height: "200px",
                    opacity: 0.5
                };

                // Set the animation duration
                var duration = 1000; // 1 second

                // Animate the element
                element.animate(properties, duration);
            });
        });
    </script>
    <style>
        #animated-element {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="animated-element">Animate Me</div>
    <button id="animate-button">Animate</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- Clicking the "Animate" button animates the `#animated-element`.
- The `animate()` method is used to animate the `width`, `height`, and `opacity` properties of the element.
- The animation duration is set to 1 second (1000 milliseconds). You can adjust the duration as needed.

You can customize this code to animate different CSS properties and specify their target values based on your requirements.
